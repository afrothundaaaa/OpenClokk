# OpenClokk
A lightweight and Open-Source Digital Clock. Since there are little to no Digital Clock applications that I trust out on the web, this was the only safe way to make exactly what I wanted. (There is much more to come).

I really want to integrate some nice features (like storing user configuration via .ini file or .xml or something so that they can choose color pallates and themes/skins/layout etc.) This will take some time, as I am new to C#. But I encourage anyone to use this software if they are looking for a solid/simple widget-style application that persists on the desktop without having to worry about viruses/malware/etc from other clock software.
